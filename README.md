## Building

### OS X

To compile this project, the Xcode Command Line Tools and CMake are required.
Xcode Command Line Tools can be downloaded and installed from the "Downloads"
tab in Xcode's settings. An easy way of installing CMake is to do it via
Homebrew: With Homebrew installed, type `brew install cmake` in a terminal.

In order to prepare the build, the following commands can be used.

    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build
    $ cmake -GXcode ..


At this point, there is an Xcode project `soundplanelib.xcodeproj` ready for coding
and compiling in `build/`. If you just want to build the example application and run it
from the comfort of the terminal, these commands can be used:

    $ xcodebuild -project soundplanelib.xcodeproj -target helloSoundplane -configuration Debug
    $ open examples/Debug/helloSoundplane

To install soundplanelib.a and the headers for use in other applications, run the
install target from the build directory:

    $  xcodebuild -project soundplanelib.xcodeproj -target install

All of the XCode targets can also be run from the XCode GUI app.



### Linux

On Linux, the libusb library is used for USB communications. On Ubuntu/Debian
the following command should install it:

    $ sudo apt-get install cmake libusb-1.0.0-dev

In order to fetch source dependencies and build, the following commands can be
used (in a terminal)

    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build
    $ cmake ..
    $ make

On Linux, the Soundplane application typically uses udev to access Soundplane
via USB. On most stock Linux installations, the default configuration is to block
non-superuser access to the Soundplane. In order to allow the Soundplane
application to access the device, add a udev rule that allows it:

    $ sudo cp Data/59-soundplane.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/
    $ sudo udevadm control --reload-rules

The app can now be run with

    $ examples/helloSoundplane

## Packaging

**NOTE**

_This is currently broken_

If desired, it is possible to build a Debian package with the command

    $ make Soundplane_deb
